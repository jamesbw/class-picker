Patent experts need to be able to explain science to the judge and jury.  But they also must help the litigators choose which legal issues to press and which to concede, and to be aware of how the complications of the science might help, hurt, obscure or reveal how the law should be applied to the facts.

Alternatively, is culture a crucial constitutive element of the mind? If so, what are specific mechanisms underlying this constitution process? And what theoretical framework do we need to make a visible progress on these questions? More generally, how can we start discussing meaningfully and productively about various problematic dichotomies such as mind versus body, culture versus biology, and nurture versus nature? An emerging field of cultural neuroscience has the potential of addressing these and other important questions and thus bridging natural, behavioral, and social sciences of the human mind.  This seminar reviews the field of cultural neuroscience. It starts with a discussion of some theoretical foundations of the field, including cultural psychology, cognitive and social neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and population genetics (PART 1). We will then discuss several specific content domains with a focus on cross-cultural variations in brain responses (PART 2). The seminar will conclude with a discussion on gene x environment interaction in varying cultural contexts (PART 3).  Students can take the seminar for credit.

Records of exposure to a variety of chemicals in the areas you have lived are only a few clicks away on the web; as are thousands of studies and informal reports on the effects of different diets, to which you can compare your own. What does this all mean for you? Never before in history humans have recorded so much information about themselves and the world that surrounds them. Nor has this data been so readily available to the lay person. Expression as \"data deluge'' are used to describe such wealth as well as the loss of proper bearings that it often generates.  How to summarize all this information in a useful way? How to boil down millions of numbers to just a meaningful few? How to convey the gist of the story in a picture without misleading oversimplifications? To answer these questions we need to consider the use of the data, appreciate the diversity that they represent, and understand how people instinctively interpret numbers and pictures. During each week, we will consider a different data set  to be summarized with a different goal. We will review analysis of similar problems carried out in the past and explore if and how the same tools can be useful today. We will pay attention to contemporary media (newspapers, blogs, etc.) to identify settings similar to the ones we are examining and critique the displays and summaries there documented. Taking an experimental approach, we will evaluate the effectiveness of different data summaries in conveying the desired information by testing them on subsets of the enrolled students.",

These will include discussions of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, sub-prime and Alt-A mortgages and the flaws of AAA CDOs; the spectacular losses by Orange County and the Florida Local Government Investment Pool and the challenges posed by unregulated investment pools; how credit default swaps are likely to change with central clearing using the PIIGS (Portugal/ Ireland/ Iceland/ Greece/ Spain), the monolines, AIG, Lehman and MF Global as examples; views of rogue trading using the similarities and disparities of Askin, Madoff, Barings, Soc Gen and UBS for discussion; and Risk Management 101 : the why/ how/ where/ when firms went wrong plus what to keep and what to throw out in the next phase of risk programs among other case studies. The subject matter, by necessity, is multi-disciplinary and so the course is particularly suited to those students having an interest in public policy and the evolution of modern financial markets. This includes students from the law or business schools, or the public policy, economics, EES, political science, or financial math and engineering programs among others. Several themes will tie the case studies, reading and discussions together:-Is this an example of an innovation that got too far ahead of existing operations, risk management, legal, accounting, regulatory or supervisory oversight?-How might temporary infrastructure be implemented without stifling innovation or growth?-How might losses be avoided by requiring permanent infrastructure sooner? Will Dodd-Frank, Basel III, etc., help to prevent such problems? What are the potential unintended consequences?-Is this an example of improperly viewing exposures that are subject to uncertainty or incorrectly modeling risk or both? Guest speakers will be invited to share their experiences. This course will aim to provide a practitioner(s) view of financial engineering over the past 3 Â½ decades as well as a broad understanding of what went right and what went wrong plus cutting edge views of the future of financial engineering.

The United NationsÂ¿ Food and Agriculture Organization states that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.  The Stanford ChangeLabs has initiated a project called the 100 Liter Water project, designed to form strategies that will deliver a minimum of 100 liters of water per day per family to the poorest communities in the world.  This class is meant primarily for Graduate students and Seniors with strong design and mechanical engineering backgrounds.  This is a self-directed project class is restricted to 15 students, who are selected through an application process.  Please go to  https://xxxx to apply for this project based class being offered in Fall 2012-13.  Students are expected to work individually and in teams on specific water related technologies such as Solar based low flow pumping systems, rainwater catchment systems, and storage systems.  The studio class will entail working on the design of Solar Powered low flow pumps, rainwater catchment systems, and very low cost storage systems designed for sparsely distributed communities in water stressed regions of the world.  Students will be expected to work with autonomy and self-direction, going through multiple rounds of prototyping to generate breakthrough technologies designed to make deep impact.",

Principles from acoustics, mechanics, and hydrodynamics will be used to build a foundational understanding of one of the most complex, interdisciplinary, and fascinating areas of biology. Topics include the evolution of hearing, computational modeling approaches, fluid-structure interactions, ion-channel transduction, psychoacoustics, diagnostic tools, and micrometer to millimeter scale imaging methods. We will also study current technologies for mitigating hearing loss via passive and active prostheses, as well as future regenerative therapies.",

This course examines persuasion, the influencing of attitudes, beliefs or behavior, and locates within that broad subject argumentation, the process of reasoning methodically from evidence.  Argumentation, the socially acceptable method of persuasion, typically confines itself to the rules of logic and has as its goal the recognition of states and causal relationships held by the arguer to objectively exist.  Other methods of persuasion can succeed while flouting those rules, but only within limits, as the story of the Emperor's New Clothes reminds us.  This course will explore whether those limits be accounted for by the capacity limitations and heuristics and biases of human information processing.  Topics to be covered include evolutionary explanations; the central and peripheral routes to persuasion; source, channel and receiver factors; attitude-behavior consistency; the roles of involvement, elaboration, affect and social influence; critical thinking skills and logical fallacies.

Viral videos, uprisings from Tahrir to #OWS, free search engines, abundant inaccuracy and sophisticated disinformation online, indelible and searchable digital footprints, laptops in lecture halls and BlackBerries at the dinner table, twenty-something social media billionaires, massive online university courses -- it's hard to find an aspect of daily life around the world that is not being transformed by the tweets, blogs, wikis, apps, movements, likes and plusses, tags, text messages,  and comments two billion Internet users and six billion mobile phone users emit. New individual and collaborative skills are emerging. This course introduces students to both the literature about and direct experience of these new literacies: research foundations and practical methods to control attention, attitudes and tools necessary for critical consumption of information, best practices of individual digital participation and collective participatory culture, the use of collaborative media and methodologies, and the application of network know-how to life online. Contrasting perspectives are offered in the readings and explored through classroom and online discussion. In each three hour class, the instructor will lecture for approximately one half hour, student project teams will present and facilitate discussion about mindmaps and the lexicon for approximately one half hour, students will engage in group activities for about an hour, and instructor will facilitate full class discussion for about an hour. Students actively collaborate and cooperate in their learning during and between classes through small group discussions and face to face exercises, forums, blogs, mindmaps and wikis.

Argumentation, the socially acceptable method of persuasion, typically confines itself to the rules of logic and has as its goal the recognition of states and causal relationships held by the arguer to objectively exist.  Other methods of persuasion can succeed while flouting those rules, but only within limits, as the story of the Emperor's New Clothes reminds us.  This course will explore whether those limits be accounted for by the capacity limitations and heuristics and biases of human information processing.  Topics to be covered include evolutionary explanations; the central and peripheral routes to persuasion; source, channel and receiver factors; attitude-behavior consistency; the roles of involvement, elaboration, affect and social influence; critical thinking skills and logical fallacies.

Viral videos, uprisings from Tahrir to #OWS, free search engines, abundant inaccuracy and sophisticated disinformation online, indelible and searchable digital footprints, laptops in lecture halls and BlackBerries at the dinner table, twenty-something social media billionaires, massive online university courses -- it's hard to find an aspect of daily life around the world that is not being transformed by the tweets, blogs, wikis, apps, movements, likes and plusses, tags, text messages,  and comments two billion Internet users and six billion mobile phone users emit. New individual and collaborative skills are emerging. This course introduces students to both the literature about and direct experience of these new literacies: research foundations and practical methods to control attention, attitudes and tools necessary for critical consumption of information, best practices of individual digital participation and collective participatory culture, the use of collaborative media and methodologies, and the application of network know-how to life online. Contrasting perspectives are offered in the readings and explored through classroom and online discussion. In each three hour class, the instructor will lecture for approximately one half hour, student project teams will present and facilitate discussion about mindmaps and the lexicon for approximately one half hour, students will engage in group activities for about an hour, and instructor will facilitate full class discussion for about an hour. Students actively collaborate and cooperate in their learning during and between classes through small group discussions and face to face exercises, forums, blogs, mindmaps and wikis.

The first part of each lecture will focus on the different design aspects of an engineering project, including formation of the design team, developing a project statement, generating design ideas and specifications, finalizing the design, and reporting the outcome. Students will form teams to follow these procedures in designing a term project of their choice over the quarter. The second part of each lecture will consist of outside speakers, including founders of some of the most exciting companies in Silicon Valley, who will share their experiences about engineering design. On-site visits to Silicon Valley companies to showcase their design processes will also be part of the course. The seminar serves three purposes: (1) it introduces students to the design process of turning an idea into a final design, (2) it presents the different functions that people play in a project, and (3) it gives students a chance to consider what role in a project would be best suited to their interests and skills.",

The first part is hands-on micro- and nano-fabrication including the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility (SNF) and the Stanford Nanocharacterization Laboratory (SNL) and field trips to local companies and other research centers to illustrate the many applications; these include semiconductor integrated circuits ('chips'), DNA microarrays, microfluidic bio-sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The second part is to create, design, propose and execute a project. Most of the grade will be based on the project. By the end of the course you will, of course, be able to read critically a New York Times article on nanotechnology. More importantly you will have experienced the challenge (and fun) of designing, carrying out and presenting your own experimental project. As a result you will be better equipped to choose your major. This course can complement (and differs from) the seminars offered by Profs Philip Wong and Hari Manoharan in that it emphasizes laboratory work and an experimental student-designed project.

        "desc": "Nanotechnology is an often used word and it means many things to different people. Scientists and Engineers have some notion of what nanotechnology is, societal perception may be entirely different. In this course, we start with the classic paper by Richard Feynman (\"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\"), which laid down the challenge to the nanotechnologists. Then we discuss two classic books that offer a glimpse of what nanotechnology is: Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology by Eric Drexler, and Prey by Michael Crichton. Drexler's thesis sparked the imagination of what nano machinery might do, whereas Crichton's popular novel channeled the public's attention to this subject by portraying a disastrous scenario of a technology gone astray. We will use the scientific knowledge to analyze the assumptions and predictions of these classic works. We will draw upon the latest research advances to illustrate the possibilities and impossibilities of nanotechnology.",

This course focuses on some of the climate problems and engineering challenges that seem most critical in addressing climate change.  Come join us for fascinating lectures and share ideas as to what engineering approaches maybe of most promise in this area. Very short weekly assignments (half page) to prepare for discussions with the lecturers; suggestions for further readings; and short optional student presentations on topics of interest will round out the class.

The original theory was primarily point-to-point, studying how fast information can flow across an isolated noisy communication channel. Until recently, there has been only limited success in extending the theory to a network of interacting nodes. Progress has been made in the past decade driven by engineering interest in wireless networks. The course provides a unified overview of this recent progress made in information theory of wireless networks. Starting with an overview of the capacity of fading and multiple-antenna wireless channels, we aim to answer questions such as: What is the optimal way for users to cooperate and exchange information in a wireless network? How much benefit can optimal cooperation provide over traditional communication architectures? How can cooperation help to deal with interference between multiple wireless transmissions?

Aimed at two sorts of students: domain experts who can define key domain specific language elements that capture domain knowledge, and computer scientists who can implement these DSLs using a new DSL framework in Scala. First half of the course will focus on understanding the infrastructure for implementing DSLs in Scala and developing techniques for defining good DSLs. Second half of the course will focus on example DSLs that provide both high-productivity and performance. During the second half of the course groups of students will develop and implement their own DSLs using the Delite DSL process of implementing DSLs for parallel computation.
